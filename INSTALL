======================= Dependencies =========================

* JDK 7 or better
* Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc)
* (Cabal)
  


============================ SETUP ===========================

** Cabal should pack together with the ghc compiler, if not, 
** it must be installed separately. It can be used to install
** some additional libraries.
cabal update
cabal install unordered-containers

** Set up the parser (written in Java) 
make install
** this does not work, for example if JDK is not installed, a
** precompiled version exists. This should only require JRE to
** be installed.
cp verifier/Parser.jar .

============================ RUN ============================

** To use the program
make r=<PATH_TO_PROTOCOL>.xml

** Note that there are example protocols. For example, to run
** the Alternating Bit Protocol, run
make r=Examples/ABP.xml

** Or run all the tests automatically
make test
