Parameterized verification of algorithms is in general an undecidable problem, but nevertheless, solid correctness results are important in many real-life applications. It is commonly the case that such algorithms rely on unbounded buffers for their operation, communication algorithms being a typical example. Building upon abstract interpretation techniques, this project presents a verification algorithm capable of verifying the correctness of algorithms relying on unbounded \emph{lossy} buffers.

A working prototype of the algorithm was created and used to verify a number of well-known communication algorithms. The experimental results are mixed, but in most cases comparable to that of other avaiable tools for this cause, justifying further research on the topic.
