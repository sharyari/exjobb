    \frametitle{Verification}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Verification is the “process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase”[1]
      \item
        Model checking is the task of automatically verifying the correctness of a program, with regard to its specification.
      \item
        This is generally done through an exhaustive graph search
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

    \frametitle{Channel Systems}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        A channel system is a system that relies on channels for its operation, e.g. communication protocols
      \item
        If buffers are unbounded, the model checking of such protocols corresponds to searching an infinite graph – an undecidable problem 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

    \frametitle{Small Models}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        One technique of overcoming this problem is to use small models
      \item
        For some types of problems, a small problem instance may exhibit all the relevant behavior of a larger system
      \item
        Using small models, undecidable verification problems can be made decidable
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Problem Formulation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Combine the ideas of small models with that of a well-known verification technique – abstract interpretation – to be applicable on channel systems
      \item
        Implement the verification algorithm
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

    \frametitle{Remaining Work}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Complete the implementation
      \item
        Carry out case studies
      \item
        Carry out comparisons towards similar verification tools
    \end{itemize}
