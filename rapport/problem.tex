In \ref{parosh}, the authors propose a verification method for \e{parameterized systems} and show that how they can, under certain assumption, be verified for an unbounded number of processes. This master thesis project is based on the results of this work, and aims to adapt this method for systems with unbounded channels. This is done by formally defining a model for systems working on channels, and proving that such systems have a \e{small system property} that allows us to verify their correctness by only looking at finite-state representations of the system.

The goal is further to implement the proposed verification method. For such an implementation to be useful, several extensions are proposed in order to expand the context in which the system can be used. Also, a specification language is defined with which the user can easily model problems. This type of verification generally has a high demand of computational resources, thus the efficiency of the implementation is of great importance. The method is used to model several well-known protocols, in order to compare its efficiency against other verification methods and establish its correctness.
