\section{Definitions and Terms}
\subsection{Channel Systems}
We present here the basic definition of a finite-state system with unbounded channels. Such a system can be seen as to have two parts, a \e{control part} and a \e{channel part}. The channel part is a set of channels, which may be empty or contain a sequence of messages, a \e{word}. The control part is a labeled finite-state transition system\todo{Should I make labels explicit in the definition below?} The definition below is associated to systems operating on FIFO buffers, other types of systems are covered in section \ref{extensions}. 

\paragraph{Alternating Bit Protocol.} The Alternating Bit Protocol (ABP) is a distributed protocol for transmitting data from a \e{sender} to a \e{receiver} in a network. The protocol uses two unbounded channels, $ch_M$ used to transmit messages and $ch_A$ to transmit \e{acknowledgements} of received messages. The sender sends a message with sequence number x $\in$ \{0,1\} to the receiver over channel $ch_M$, who upon reception sends an acknowledgement with the same sequence number over channel $ch_A$. Both the sender and the receiver may send the same message (with the same sequence number) repeatedly. When the sender receives an acknowledgement from the receiver, the next message can be sent using the sequence number (1-x) (thus the name Alternating Bit Protocol). This is a simple protocol that operates on unbounded channels, and it is used in this paper to illustrate the theoretical concepts in a concrete setting. The behaviour of the sender and receiver process is illustrated in figure \ref{abpgraph}

\paragraph{Definition}
\label{CS}
A channel system CS over a set of processes P and channels Ch is a tuple $\langle$S,$s_0$,A,C,M,$\delta$$\rangle$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item[]
S is a finite set of control states,
\item[]
$s_0$ is an initial control state,
\item[]
A is a finite set of actions,
\item[]
Ch is a finite set of channels,
\item[]
M is a finite set of messages,
\item[]
$\delta$ is a finite set of transitions, each of which is a triple of the form $\langle s_1,op,s_2\rangle$, where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are control states, and op is a label of one of the forms

\begin{itemize}
\item
c!m, where c $\in$ Ch and m $\in$ M
\item
c?m, where c $\in$ Ch and m $\in$ M
\item
a $\in$ A.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The finite-state control part of CS is an ordinary labeled transition system with states S, initial state $s_0$ and transitions $\delta$. The channel part is represented by the set Ch of channels, which may contain a string of messages in M. The set A denotes the set of observable interactions with the environment, whereas $\delta$ may either perform an action from A, or and unobservable action, where

\begin{itemize}
\item[]
$\langle s_1, c!m, s_2\rangle$ represents a change of state from $s_1$ to $s_2$ while appending the message m to the tail of channel c
\item[]
$\langle s_1, c?m, s_2\rangle$ represents a change of state from $s_1$ to $s_2$ while removing the message m to the head of channel c
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example.} The alternating bit protocol can be described by a channel system CS = $\langle S,i,A,Ch,M,\delta\rangle$ such that S = {(s,r)} with \e{s} $\in$ $\{s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4\}$, \e{r} $\in$ $\{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4\}$, \e{i} is the initial state ($s_1,r_1$), \e{A} = \{Snd, Rcv\}, \e{Ch} = \{$Ch_M,Ch_A$\}, M = \{1,0\} and delta is the set of transitions

\begin{ttabular}
$\langle s_1, Snd, s_2\rangle$ &
$\langle s_2, ch!0, s_2\rangle$ &
$\langle s_2, ch?1, s_2\rangle$ &
$\langle s_2, ch?0, s_3\rangle$ &
$\langle s_3, Snd, s_4\rangle$ &
$\langle s_4, ch!1, s_4\rangle$&
$\langle s_4, ch?0, s_4\rangle$&
$\langle s_4, ch?1, s_1\rangle$ \\

$\langle r_1, ch!1, r_1\rangle$ &
$\langle r_1, ch?1, r_1\rangle$&
$\langle r_1, ch?0, r_2\rangle$&
$\langle r_2, Rcv, r_3\rangle$&
$\langle r_3, ch!0, r_3\rangle$&
$\langle r_3, ch?0, r_3\rangle$&
$\langle r_3, ch?1, r_4\rangle$&
$\langle r_4, Rcv, r_1\rangle$
\end{ttabular}



\subsection{Channel Transition Systems}
A \e{transition system} is an abstract machine, commonly used in model checking to describe the behaviour of a system. They are in ways similar to the notion of finite state automata, with the difference that the states and transitions in a transition system need not be finite. A state of a transition system describing a program may be determined, for example, the evaluation of all variables in the program. Transitions describe how a system in a certain state can move to another state.

\paragraph{Definition}
\label{CTS}
The operational behaviour of CS is defined by the inifinite-state transition system TS = (C, $\rightarrow$) where
\begin{itemize}
\item[]
   C = (S $\times$ $\xi$) is the set of its configurations, where $\xi$ is an evaluation of the set of channels C in CS
\item[]
  $\rightarrow$ $\subseteq (S \times S)$ contains the following transitions
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For each observable action a $\in$ A in CS
      \[
      \dfrac{s \xrightarrow{a} s'}{(S, \xi) \rightarrow (S', \xi)}
      \]
    \item
      For each transmission action $\langle s_1, ch!m, s_2 \rangle$ in CS
      \[
      \dfrac{s \xrightarrow{ch!m} s' \wedge ch \in \xi}{(S, \xi) \rightarrow (S', \xi')} \] with \[ \xi' = \xi[ch := \xi (ch) \bullet m].
      \]
    \item
      For each reception action $\langle s_1, ch?m, s_2 \rangle$ in CS
      \[
      \dfrac{s \xrightarrow{ch?m} s' \wedge \xi(ch) = m \bullet w_1..w_n}{(S, \xi) \rightarrow (S', \xi')} \] with \[ \xi' = \xi[ch:= w_1..w_n].
      \]

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

At times we may use a notation for a configuration c with explicit processes and channels, so that c = $\conf{s_1,...,s_n, ch_1,...,ch_p}$, or alternatively, with explicit processes and channel evaluations, c = $\conf{s_1,...,s_n, \xi(ch_1),...,\xi(ch_p)}$.

\paragraph{Example}
Let $c = \conf{S,\xi}$ be a configuration of the alternating bit protocol, with the channels containing the words \e{01} and \e{10} respectively. Then c may also be denoted as $c = \conf{s,r,ch_M,ch_A}$ or as $c = \conf{s_1,s_2,01,10}$. There are finitely many control states in this system, but an infinite set of channel evaluations. A transmission transition in this system is for example $\langle\conf{s_2,r_1,01,10}$, $ch_m!1$, $\conf{s_2,r_1,011,10}\rangle$. 

\subsection{Reachability and Bad Configurations}
An instance of the \e{reachability problem} is defined by a channel transition system TS = (S,$\xi$), a set of initial configurations \e{I} $\subseteq$ $S^+$ and a set \e{BAD} $\subseteq$ $S^+$ of \e{bad configurations}. We assume that \e{Bad} is the upward closure $\{c$ | $ c \in B: b \sqsubseteq c\}$ of a set of a given \e{finite} set of \e{minimal bad configurations}. \todo{Is this true in my case?}

Let c denote a configuration, then c is said to be \emph{reachable} in TS, if there are configurations $c_1...c_l$ such that $c_0$ is an initial configuration of TS and for each 0 $\leq$ i < l, $\langle c_i, c_{i+1} \rangle \in \rightarrow$.

We use $\mathcal{R}$ to denote the set of reachable states. We say that the system \e{TS} is \e{safe} if there are no reachable bad configurations, i.e. $\mathcal{R} \cap Bad$ = $\emptyset$.

\subsection{Traces}
\todo{Define trace, minimal trace and put it into the context of bad configurations}.
