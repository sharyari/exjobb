-- Basic datatype to apply rules
-- The bytestring is the new bytestring, the tuple (chNum, op, symbol) is a read or write operation such that
-- op = ? => if the chNum:th channel contains the symbol at its end, remove the symbol
-- op = ! => append the symbol to the beginning of the chNum:th channel
-- op = ยก => append the symbol to the end of the chNum:th channel (used for stacks/lifo)
-- op = - => leave channels unchanged
